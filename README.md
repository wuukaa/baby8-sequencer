Analog sequencer


 So a friend of mine wanted to make a DIY analogish sequencer, I decided to help him by making this relatively easy schematic! You can use it in any way you want ^^
 
 All you need is a synthesizer style power supply with -12V, 0V and 12V for the opamp that buffers the input clock and CV output. Otherwise I used pretty much standard components like:
  - TL172 0.4€
  - CD4017 0.4€
  - CD4520 0.4€
  - LM555 0.4€
  - Resistors <1€
  - Pots 20€
  - Capacitors <1€
  - Diodes <1€
  - Switches/buttons 5€
  
  So you can have this for arround ~30€ so pretty cheap. Have fun to build it!
  
  Here is the schem (Yeah you should zoom it x3):

  I also put the KiCAD .sch file so if you want to make your own, go on!
