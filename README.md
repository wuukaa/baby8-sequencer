Analog sequencer


 So a friend of mine wanted to make a DIY analogish sequencer, I decided to help him by making this relatively easy schematic! You can use it in any way you want ^^
 
 All you need is a synthesizer style power supply with -12V, 0V and 12V for the opamp that buffers the input clock and CV output. Otherwise I used pretty much standard components like:
  - TL172 0.4â‚¬
  - CD4017
  - LM555
  - Resistors
  - Pots
  - Capacitors
  - Diodes
  - Switches/buttons
